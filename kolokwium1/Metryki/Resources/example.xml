	<metric type="instability">
		Afferent Couplings (Ca): The number of other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package's responsibility.
		Efferent Couplings (Ce): The number of other packages that the classes in the package depend upon is an indicator of the package's independence.
		The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce + Ca) such that I = Ce / (Ce + Ca). This metric is an indicator of the package's resilience to change. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a completely stable package and I=1 indicating a completely unstable package.
	</metric>
	<metric type="abstractness">
		The ratio of the number of abstract classes (and interfaces) in the analyzed package to the total number of classes in the analyzed package. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package.
